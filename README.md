### ADR

This project uses ADR to record architectural decisions. If you are wondering about choices we have made, explore the
`doc/adr` directory.

### Development

We use Poetry to manage dependencies. Preferably all code should be reviewed before committing to master, so please
create Pull Requests for your contributions. It is always wise to discuss the feature you want to implement in an issue
first, before starting to write code. That way you know that you are moving in the right direction.
